These are very useful links to @nutsey's v0.4 UNFEX REFEX FWINFO GETFWINFO (etc) scripts for
manipulating 'full_img.fex files'. I and other people have modified these scripts to add a
compression or other functions.
More info is on https://www.goprawn.com forums, in the Allwinner V3 and V5 sections.
Also check the Facebook group https://fb.com/groups/allwinner4kcamerasusergroup for updates.
( If you are looking for scripts to make a backup copy of firmware from your camera, then open this other link )

These scripts are for full_img.fex files that are 12058624 bytes size, and other sizes of full_img.fex may work but I'm not sure.
